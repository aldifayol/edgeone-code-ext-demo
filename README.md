# edgeone-code-ext-demo

I tried deploying this project to EdgeOne Pages, using its official extension, without initializing a Git repository.

Then I wanted to test about what happens when I initialize a Git repository and connect a remote repository like Github after deploying the project.

Does the EdgeOne Pages extension detect the project's remote repository and link it to the deployment? (Let's say we have linked a Github account to EdgeOne Pages.)

Turns out, it doesn't!

EdgeOne Pages extension does not automatically link an existing deployment to remote repository set up in the project.
