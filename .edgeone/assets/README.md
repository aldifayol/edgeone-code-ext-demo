# edgeone-code-ext-demo

I tried deploying this project to EdgeOne Pages, using its official extension, without initializing a Git repository.

Then I wanted to test about what happens when I initialize a Git repository after deploying the project.

Does the EdgeOne Pages extension detect the Git repository and link it to the deployment?

Turns out, it doesn't!
